# Finger-Gestures-Detection-using-YOLOv8
This project implements a YOLOv8-based model to detect finger gesture numbers (0-5) using a custom dataset. The goal is to create a lightweight and accurate detector that can recognize hand signs for applications in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction), sign language, and gesture control systems.
